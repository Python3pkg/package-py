You've successfully set up the package package package!
You have these new things:

* Makefile
* setup.py
* package/

Edit these files with the appropriate info:

* ./package/info.yaml
* ~/.package-py/info.yaml

NOTE: If you don't yet have the second file, you can copy the first one to
that location.

Next you should run:

    make package-info

For more help, run:

    make help
